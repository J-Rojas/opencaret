## Thank you, Polysync!

For making these opensource/openhardware. Huge step for people like us trying to hack into their cars. Now to install all the components macrofab won't do and get these ready for action!

For more info check out: https://github.com/PolySync/oscc

Now I need to find out how to tap all the gas/brake and steering sensors on my car. With that done it should be as easy as commanding the gateway to go :)

Also need to find a large parking lot somehwere!
