title: Working throttle!

## It works!

I was able to order mating connectors from ballenger motorsports and design a pretty decent Y connector to plug into my throttle position sensor and the ECU. It ACTUALLY WORKS! You have no idea how good it feels to be able to see something come to life like this!

Brake is next!
