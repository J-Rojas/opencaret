Its surprising how cheap these things are! Really fun to drive and as simple as they get. Im actually enjoying driving this car around. Has a reasonable amount of punch to it. I would say that in urban driving its definitely better than my 2017 Civic touring.

Next steps: Get a factory service manual and a wiring diagram somehow and figure out if theres a easy access point to tap at the gas, brake and steering torque sensors.
