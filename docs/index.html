As I inched along on highway 880 (SF Bay Area) on my morning commute down to Santa clara one day I realized that while level 4/5 urban self driving cars are the future and will forever change the landscape - what would really fix 98% of my driving woes immediately is simply an amazing highway autopilot system. I can easily drive the last few urban miles if the car would just handle the torture and drudgery of droning at 15mph on the highway.

I realize this is not a novel idea. However the devil is in the details. The only fully usable highway autopilot system is Tesla's today with comma.ai's openpilot being a close second. OpenCaret is my attempt to build a reliable and accurate fully opensource/opendata highway autopilot system that could be installed on any vehicle. 

<h2>So whats the idea?</h2>
I'm taking the fastest approach to having a working solution which involves getting a Kia Soul EV and putting a drive-by-wire kit on it using Polysync's OSCC (https://github.com/PolySync/oscc). 
<h2>Why opensource?</h2>
The accelerated growth of knowledge that we have seen in the software world is driven by the fact that anyone with a computer can contribute. Even though majority of the work that happens in a self driving car startup is software engineering - I realized its very hard for people to start playing in this field without joining a well funded startup or spending enough money to rig up a car.

I want to accelerate this learning by opening up the full implementation to anyone who is interested, including access to the car itself to folks who want to test code live. I hope that this accelerates tinkering and hacking in this space. The cost of a bug could be a life when a self driving car is involved - so instead of wasting human effort on reimplementing the same algorithms again and again - I hope this allows us to come up with novel solutions and advance the state of the art in a meaningful way.
