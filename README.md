## Opencaret

An opensource / opendata Level-3 Highway autopilot system for all modern cars. Think Tesla Autopilot but for your civic, corolla, kia. The idea is to initially perfect this on the Kia Soul EV (since Polysync graciously gives us a opensource/openhardware drive by wire kit) and then build open hardware drive by wire kits for other cars.
